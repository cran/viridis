# viridis

[Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) recently [changed the default color map]
(http://matplotlib.org/style_changes.html) of their graphs to `viridis`. 

This color map is designed in such a way that it will analytically be perfectly 
perceptually-uniform, both in regular form and also when converted to black-and-white. 
It is also designed to be perceived by readers with the most common form of color 
blindness. 

AND... it is pretty!

AND... it is now available for R!

#### Look how pretty it is!
